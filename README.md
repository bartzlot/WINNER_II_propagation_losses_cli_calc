# WINNER II Propagation Losses CLI Calculator

## Overview

The WINNER II Propagation Losses CLI Calculator is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to calculate propagation losses based on the WINNER II channel model. This tool is useful for researchers and engineers working in the field of wireless communications, specifically those dealing with propagation loss models. Supported scenarios (B1, C2, D1) for both LOS and NLOS line-of-sigth state.

## Features

- **Flexible Input**: Accepts various parameters such as frequency, distance, and environment type to compute propagation losses.
- **Accurate Calculations**: Utilizes the WINNER II model to provide reliable propagation loss values for different scenarios.
- **CLI Interface**: Simple command-line menu-like interface operative with arrows, spacebar and enter.
